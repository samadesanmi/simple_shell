.SH DESCRIPTION

.B Simple shell
it is a simple version of a command line interpreter for the system. The simple shell read lines from either the terminal, interpretes them, and generally executes other commands. It incorporates mode interactive and non-interactive, the commands can be executed while the program is running or can be executing a command within a file directly by the shell.

.SS INVOCATION

To start the interactive mode the program will be executed, then starts the mode indicated by '$', to exit of the mode type 'exit' or type 'ctrl + d' and in the mode non-interactive the location that contains the command to be executed must be specified in the command line.

.SS EXECUTION

The program takes the arguments of the command line in a string and it is tokenizes into words using "space" as a delimiter, the first word is consider the command and all remaining are considered the arguments to that command. If the command is valid:

1. If the first argument is different to '.', '/' or shell builtin, the program searches in the PATH and then invocates it.
2. If the first character is '.' or '/', the program executes that typed command with the passed argument.

.SH SEE ALSO

psh(1), environ(7), ksh(1), test(1)

.SS Command Exit status 

The Exit command status could vary depending of the typed command and his behavior, in the caso of a builtin command return exit codes, as does an executed shell function.

.SS EXIT STATUS

Errors that are detected by the shell, such a syntax error, will cause an exit specifying that file or directory does not exist. If a type a command with a syntax error, the output specifies 'No such file or directory'.
